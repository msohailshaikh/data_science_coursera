# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

run_analysis implements the following steps to create a tidy dataset:

1.Merges the training and the test sets for X, y, and subject
2.Appropriately labels each measurement. X is labeled with features.txt
3.Extracts the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
4.Adds activity names to the data set
5.Creates a second data set with the average of each variable (feature) for each activity and each subject. 

## Combined data set looks like this
