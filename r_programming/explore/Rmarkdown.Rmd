===========================================

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **MD** toolbar button for help on Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
plot(cars)
```

Lets check out writting sentences.

```{r computetime, echo=FALSE}
time <- format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %X %Y")
rand <- rnorm(1)
```
The current time is `r time`. My favorite random number is `r rand`.

Now lets make a table.

```{r fitmodel}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp + Solar.R, data = airquality)
```
Here is a table of regression coefficients.
```{r showtable, results = "asis"}
library(xtable)
xt <- xtable(summary(fit))
print(xt, type = "html")
```
